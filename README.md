Introducing the Blueprint Book Generator: Effortlessly populate your virtual scenes with realistic books, without the need for manual placement.
Customize libraries, avoid collisions, and streamline your creative process.

In this project you can find the book tool blueprint, 12 books static meshes (https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/architectural/decoration/12-hardcover-beige-books) and an editor utility blueprint that allows you to bake and save your blueprint into one singular static mesh actor.

To bake just right click n the actor > Scripted actions > Convert Static mesh
